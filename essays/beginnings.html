<br>
                    Skill build: Max Missle by level 7, get Ultimate at 6, 11, and 16. Stick Stats in early until level 12, then get command aura.<br>
<br>
                    Item build: Get Tangoes early, about 8, do not get RoR. Get extremely cheap items such as bracers and circlets. Your ideal slots by level 7 should be Boots, Tangoes, 2 circs and 2 bracers, or some variation such as clarities or TP. Build up to Manta, and use it after ult.<br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Stygian, Linkens, Bashers, Malestrom<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Stun means you will be team's primary ganker. Carry TP so you can keep your enemy on their toes by TPing to different lanes and TPing to heal and immeadiately to another lane. Initiate battle with your ult and manta. Stun dangerous heroes with disables or crazy ult such as CM or Enigma first.<br>

                    Enchantress<br>
<br>
                    Skill build: Max Impetus by level 7, get ultimate whenever you feel physical attacks will be stronger than nukes. (Usually around midgame or level 10/11) Get one level of heal, then get more if your team needs to push early. (It shouldn’t) Stick in the rest with stats.<br>
<br>
                    Carry Build: Tangoes+Clarities+circs, build to boots and midas, do not get bracers. Get relic and get radiance or dr. aegis. Get Guinsoo if your team needs. Only get BoT<br>
<br>
                    Classic: Bracers+BoT rush. Get Guinsoo. <br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Orbs. Battlefury. Blink. <br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Powerful orb and range means solo. Use orb excessively, but never to farm like Silencer or Clinkz. You should get wards if mid so you can harass while their hero is being pussy. Avoid ganks, carry a TP, do not gank early, you have no real nukes. You will be powerful mid-game if you are farmed. In team battles, have heal on and sit and kill their Int heroes with your Arrow Effect. <br>

<br>
                    Item Build: Bracer and Wraith then BoT rush. If you aren’t farming well, get SY, if you are, get Bfly.<br>

<br>
                    Strategy: Farm up, try to pair up with a disabler hero. Use waveform to kill and chase. Simple hero to use really. Team battles consist of waveforming and dps.<br>

<br>
                    Strategy: Use bear to harass easily, let it regen on your headdress. Use it search out forests and do maphack. Control the heroes separately if possible. Solo. Do not rely on bear for dps, Euls is a hard counter. Use bear to last hit easily. Try to initiate battles with your bear.<br>

<br>
                    Item Build: Bracers or skip them if you can get orge axe. Blink, euls<br>

                    Items not to get: Aganhims, Damage<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Do not overrely on your ult. BKB is helpful, but only in team battles. Blink+Bite+Cyclone is usually good enough to take out a few disables for you to ult. If not, get BKB, I am not saying it’s a bad item, but don’t overrely on it. Harass in lane, and gank when you have blink. Do not solo. Read MasterJoe’s guide.<br>

                    Special Heroes and what to do:<br>
<br>
                    [list][*]Jugg: Bladefury and Facch is the only reason he is here. Play him aggressively and using omnislash takes intuition.[*]Raigor: Get Blink and chain your combo, then get focused and die. Takes skill to make use of blink beyond this, and to fissure correctly[*]Lina: Carry build is different from mek-guinsoo build. Read Premium Guide for further info. I don’t really agree with it, but it works I guess. [*]Zeus: Static field. Proper positioning is required or else you feed past level 13 or so. Use nukes to maintain control of lane.[*]Sven: Must farm well, and will be the team’s carry. Easy to use, but might lose effectiveness if proper counters.<br>
<br>
                    Heroes not to get:<br>
<br>
                    [list][*]SA: Wards and no lane control.[*]Naga: Pubstomp hero. Fairly useless in my mind until someone comes with a new strat. Don’t say using ult and then raxing.<br>
<br>
                    [size=(7)]Sunrise Tavern[/size]<br>
<br>
                    Heroes to play: Tinker, Silencer, Furion, Enigma, Chen<br>
                    Special Heroes:  Tiny, Kotl, Tree<br>
                    Heroes not to play: Ursa, Orge Magi, Techies, PL<br>
<br>
                    [b]Tinker[/b]<br>
<br>
                    Skill Build: Get Missle maxed by 7. Get Laser with it, maxed by 8. Get Rearm whenever you have the mana to support it or you have BoTs. Usually around 11 or so, and you have your items. Get March when you have a Eul’s and can teleport around the map many times without going back to base. Around this time, creep waves are getting bigger too. (Around level 14-17) Level up Rearm when you have Guinsoo’s because 350 mana is not a joke.<br>
<br>
                    Item Build: I suggest Eul’s because it allows you to rearm while heroes are cycloned, and it is very powerful as a first item. However, rearm allows you to have infinite mana with BoT, so if you are farming well, rush to BoT. <br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Damage, Necrobook, BKB, Arcane Ring, Dagon<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Play aggressively in lane, most heroes will not be able to deal with your nukes. Your animation is decent for last hitting and harassing and you have good range so lane control should be easy. Play aggressively with nukes and use Clarities and Tangoes. Most heroes cannot deal with your nukes. Try and be paired with a disabler. I am not a great Tinker, so if anybody wants to add to this, please feel free to post.<br>
<br>
                    Guide Recommendation: None as of yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
                    [b]Silencer[/b]<br>
<br>
                    Skill Build: Glaives-stats to level 10, get Global Silence at 10, and max out last word after.<br>
<br>
                    Item Build: Try a few bracers then rush to BoT. You can get a Midas if and only if you are the carry and can farm it reasonably. Otherwise finish BoT and get guinsoo. Finish the build with a butterfly or hyper. Get a mek only if you started with a RoR, and there are no other heroes to get Mek. (Chen) I am not a fan of Mek stack. <br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Dagon, Nulls, Treads<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Harass with your Orb (manual cast) and orb walk at level 7. Play with Tangoes, because you will need the quick regen instead of a RoR. TP around and farm with the BoT. Play as dps in team battles, and initiate them with Global Silence. Farm with your orb, it helps last hitting a great deal. Concentrate on weaker heroes during team battles and position yourself so heroes are under last word.<br>

                    [b]Enigma[/b]<br>
<br>
                    Skill Build: Max Malefice by 7. Get two levels of stats in between and your ult. Finish Midnight pulse from 8,9,10,11. Don’t level your ult in most cases.<br>
<br>
                    Item Build: BKB, BoT, Aegis. You have good str growth, but get bracers if you are dying a lot. I suggest just saving 1000 for the Orge axe.<br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Dagon and everything else basically. Blink is useful, but not as useful as one would think on paper.<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: BKB-Midnight Pulse-Black hole is all you need to do in team battles. Malefice stragglers. Pair up with a disabler hero in lane and rake in kills early. Malefice is very strong in ganks. Don’t go mid. Initiate battles with Black Hole. Use Black Hole more often, I see too many noobs try and “save” it for a 5v5 team battle, use it if you think you can get a kill or two during a gank. <br>

                    Items not to get: Stygian, Dagon, Agahnims<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Farm and solo if possible. Run around ganking with tele-sprout. You should farm until level 7 or so in lane. Don’t gank until that time. Be the primary DPS of the team. Cast Ult whenever you can. Explore the map before the game starts if its –rd or –lm.<br>
<br>
                    Guide Recommendation: None that use this build, which I think is the best. <br>
<br>
                    [b]Chen[/b]<br>
<br>
                    Skill Build: Test of Faith-Pentinence-persuasionx3-ult-persuasion-pent x3-Don’t finish Test of Faith.<br>
<br>
                    Item Build: Mek to Guinsoo or Necrobook if you are feeling bold.<br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Stygian and Dagon<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: With the recent nerfs, concentrate on either stunners or Satyrs. Satyrs are monsters at pushing with the shockwave. Centaurs are better than Furblogs. Get a troll priest early if you can find one for the heal. Use Test of faith to tele heroes back to base. 6 secs cast and 3 secs cast on ToF is the essentially the same. Practice Microing the creeps to stun and to use shockwave. Pentinence their weakest hero so your team can take them out. Gank repeatedly throughout the map. Watch out for people who ward creep spots. Buy a shitload of sentries. <br>

<br>
                    [list][*]Tiny: Avalance and Toss take some degree of skill. Does not suit the metagame very well anymore, with no lane control and low armor. Grow is used to later carry with Butterfly.[*] KotL: Illuminate and Chakra, and who to use mana leak on. Takes some practice to use your nuke. Must have a good team for this hero to be useful. Do not emphasize pushing TOO much. I see this too much.[*] Tree: When to use ult. [/list]<br>

                    [list][*]Ursa: Solo hero killer. 5 hits and he’s useless.[*] Orge Magi: Higher Level play has no time for randomness.[*] Techies: See above.

                    Skill Build: Axes until level 7, squeeze in one level of summons, and get ult whenever possible. Get Beast Rage if you need to deal more damage in team battles, but not too early.<br>
<br>
                    Item Build: I really like Radiance on this hero, but some people like going Necrobook. Which one you choose is personal preference and depends on your matchup.  Beastmaster is a pretty flexible hero, and can be good with many items.<br>
<br>
                    Items not to get: Mask of Madness, SY<br>
<br>
                    Strategy: Early on, try and focus on using axes and harassing with them. If you can get a lanemate with Basilus, then do it. When you hit level 6, you can gank easily and use your ult to initiate battle. Use your crow for a mobile ward. Try running it through common spots like forests and rivers to explore. Good usage just takes experience, but remember that your crow is probably one of the best map awareness spells in DotA.<br>

                    Skill Build: Dual Breath-Stats, get icepath from 8-11, then macropyre after. I find that macropyre isn’t worth the mana early and dual breath stats allows one to stay in lane forever.<br>

<br>
                    Strategy: Use dual breath to massacre your lane, and use ice path in team battles. Land a macropyre near tower to stop enemy team from tower hugging. Simple hero to use, I think. Use Eul’s to delay your cooldowns.<br>

Hex is mana intensive, but should be gotten so that it is maxed when early game is about over and you have your eul’s. Late game, use your wards and refresher to take down towers and raxes. You have three disables so you will be a very high target. Try and stay back while your disables are cooling down and remember to disable their dps and heavy damage output heroes.<br>

In team battles, initiate with your blink-stomp and just tank for the rest of your team. Getting an aegis will help balance out that huge HP you have, and Radiance will help in team battles as well.
