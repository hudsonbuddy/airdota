            <p><i>“The only true beauty is power”</i><br>
<br>
            Medusa has been buffed repeatedly ever since being added to -CM in 6.79 and her Stone Gaze re-work. With the release of 6.82, her winrate has shot up, from 48% to peaking at just under 56%, a difference close to 8%. In this meta, true hard carries are finally given a chance to comeback; they can make up for any early-game deficit with smart play, good farm and choosing the right fights. <br>
<br>
            However, this hero still has room to grow as a carry. With the recent buff in 6.82 to Mana Shield, she now has no equal in terms of tankiness, and dps, especially with the right items. The point of this hero is to carry through pure attrition. Attrition through farm, tankiness, and steady damage. Out of the six heroes with only “carry” as their role in DotA 2, Medusa is the only one that doesn’t fall off. <br>
<br>
            <b>Get Phase-Aquila-MoM</b><br>
<br>
            These three items together make Medusa into an absolute terror. Getting Phase in lane allows the Medusa to have the absolute best positioning, ready to plink targets and harass them with high damage and while also escaping from ganks. Aquila offers mana-regen, allows you to push when fights are going on elsewhere by giving armor to creeps, and gives 3-way stats, which is insanely efficient on Medusa. Finally, the Mask of Madness is the core item that you use to accelerate your farm. <br>
<br>
            Medusa is a hero that relies on jumping up farming phases. Your starting items get you to your Aquila, which gets you to Phase, which then helps you to MoM. With MoM and high level split-shot, you can duck in and out of the jungle, ancients, and lanes at 522 and farm extremely fast, all the while pressuring lanes with creep equilibrium and dodging ganks. <br>
<br>
            <b>Stack Skadi’s and Rapiers</b><br>
<br>
            People will try a bunch of different items of Medusa, but there are really only two items that you need to get, and they are the Eye of Skadi and Divine Rapier. No other items give you better value. Double Skadi, double rapier is not a troll build. <br>
            <br>
            Butterfly offers evasion and damage, but you don’t want a mix of the two, you either want one or the other, depending on the stage of the game. Linkens is expensive and the spell block is only useful on heroes that are slippery like Weaver, Slark, Puck etc. Mjollnir gives AoE, but you have split shot! Manta however, is great because you can get a Yasha after your MoM to speed up farm and go straight into Skadi. <br>
<br>
            <b>Don’t get Mystic Snake</b><br>
<br>
            This skill has been getting buffs lately, but fundamentally, it still just goes against what Medusa is trying to do. As a farming skill, it wastes your mana because creeps don’t have mana and spilt shot is good now. As a nuke, unless you hit 3+ targets with mana, it actively hurts you. Harassing in lane should just be with little plinks from your high base damage. If you skip snake, you can have maxed Mana Shield ASAP which gives an insane amount of tankiness early game. You are then literally ungankable from level 7 and on because of the time it takes people to kill you. The 100 gold TP’s mean you can just turn and shoot when your teammates come to back you up. <br>
<br>
            Also, since you skipped Snake, your split-shot will be maxed by lvl 10, which is when you should be getting your MoM. You can use the combination of the two to efficiently farm jungle, stacks, etc, all of which Mystic Snake is useless for. The opportunity cost of the +8 to stats is also just incredible. every time you get stats instead of a skill, it saves inventory slots, and most importantly, it also changes the way people perceive your hero. When playing dota, you kind of get a feel of how squishy someone is, but if they have been getting stats, it throws you off. Example: A Warlock that goes heal-stats, and is unusually tanky compared to a warlock that maxed bonds or the slow. <br>
<br>
            The Medusa ultimate is the best disengagement spell there is. You can just TP down into a team fight where your boys are losing, pop your ult, and everyone has to scatter. Medusa is in the bottom 10 of heroes played all-time in DotA 2, discounting new heroes, and her new ult was just changed in 6.78. The ult used to be just whenever it’s on, if you’re looking at her, you get slowed, but now there is a 2s counter that, if met, stuns you. The duration is also 1s longer, so when you think the ult is almost over and you try and turn(with the turn rate slow) you get those last .5s it takes to stun you for 3s. <br>
<br>
            <b>Rhythm</b><br>
<br>
            This hero’s tempo can be described like this: with every minute that goes by and you’re not losing, you’re winning. This hero is a no-gimmick carry. She is just an upward slope of carry potential through time. She has power peaks when she first pulls out the MoM, Skadi and Rapier, respectively, but she doesn’t start dropping anywhere. Heroes like Drow, Luna can drop off because they are so squishy, but Medusa doesn’t have this problem. Do not pick fights unnecessarily because you are a fast pusher with split shot, and one support TPing in doesn’t mean you have to back, you can just keep pushing the tower, forcing one of the big brothers to come in too. This is surprisingly effective, because it forces a core to their offlane, suspending their farm. <br>
<br>
            Fights that you should take are ones where your team is on the defensive and there is nothing to do but fight, i.e. tower dives. An aggressive move that turns into a garbage fight in their jungle is not something you should TP to, and even pushes, you probably should not be going. <br>
<br>
            Later into the game, you just need to stand your ground in fights and fight with the team. You can man fight anyone not because you can out dps them, it’s because they can’t kill you fast enough for your team not to react. Some faults, you are not mobile so you can get kited around lanes by spilt pushers, and you are literally unable to get solo kills. You need to think like you are just a mobile tower. Otherwise, push lanes, keep the farm going and make them come to you, because at the end of the day, you are the final carry. <br>
<br>
            <b>Misc thoughts:</b><br>
<br>
            <i>You can phase through heroes that are running away from your ult and keep them in the effect.</i> <br>
<br>
            <i>She counters illusion heroes hard, like CK, TB, PL, Naga, etc because her ult kills them instantly. Her ult used to be purge, which was like an instant kill for illusions and Warlock golems; the same thing that diffusal blade is based on now. Purge was and always has been a huge illusion counter.</i><br>
<br>
            <i>I don’t believe mystic snake is not an elegant skill because it still has not parted from what Medusa used to be. The skill is inspired by Chain Lightning, which also was a bouncing nuke. I think IceFrog basically tried to get fancy with a rework, but even back in those days, the Mana Shield-Stats trading build was the way to go, getting split shot later because it was horrible early.</i><br>

        <p style="margin-top: 150px">Mana shield is essentially max level bristleback, but at every angle (2.5x ehp vs all damage types)</p> 
        <p style="margin-top: 180px">You are super hard to gank because you are never really on the mini-map</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 200px">Images have spilt shot!</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px">(Remember, mana is life!) Mystic snake is only really worth it if you max it because the mana cost scales horribly compared to the mana drained and bounces, but you can’t get it early because you want mana shield and split shot, and later game, stats are better.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px">Maybe get stats if you want before maxing Split Shot past lvl 2-3, you just want it maxed when you want to start mowing down waves ASAP and ducking back to farm stacks.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px">TB, Phoenix, ES, Techies</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 200px">And remember, any time you’re beating their farm, you’re winning :)</p>
