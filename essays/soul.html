            <p>As for the patch, IMO:<br>
<br>
            1. Cumback<br>
            2. Carry v Carry<br>
            3. Resource Efficiency/Decisive<br>
<br>
            1. Everyone knows about this by now, you can feasibly get 2k gold from just one kill now which means greed is rewarded and early advantages (5-10k and less) are no longer gg-leads.<br>
            2. Because carries are highlighted, carry v carry fights or fights that have both carries there are the most important engagements in the game now. Small garbage fights matter less. Carries should be harder to kill, so miss chance/disarm comes in here, and bashers are huge for the carry v carry fights.<br>
            3. Farming and not sitting around mid jerking off is super important, the pendulum is swinging back to the days where you can stack camps and farm them with illuminate/etc. Lanes shouldn't be left empty so you that don't miss a big fight, it's ok to miss the early fight, make them waste time finding you after and then just winning the comeback fight at the bottom of your stairs. In addition, lane tempo is incredibly important, pushing lanes fast and getting back into the jungle; TPs are 100 gold now.<br>
<br>
            Here are some quick links:<br>

<br>
            I think the best way to take advantage of this patch is to pick cores that can stand hard, i.e. be able to solo lanes and take advantage of the farm, while picking supports that wave clear and can survive for responses to come in.<br>
<br>
            Specific Xamples:<br>
            Medusa, we were talking about this last night and basically you just go phase-mom-ring and skip snake and just farm, clearing waves to force responses to defend while hasting around your jungle and ancients<br>
            PA, the blur now essentially makes it so the other team literally doesn't put you on their radar, and they just ignore you while they do their thing and you just push their tower before they even know what happened. also, people will blindly tp, thats how you got those insane solo kills cuz they just see an empty lane, shes literally an assassin getting solo kills cuz of that blindness, Also, the blur is incredible for carry v carry fights, and she naturally wants basher, goes with wisp, i love this hero right now if you cant tell, she is the only in dota to have never gotten nerfed<br>
            Spec, can just farm around and come in for team fights, radiance I think is important because of the aoe and ability to push fast. heads down radiance<br>
            Silencer, can solo carries with disarm and lanes well with orb, and fits xuan well<br>
            Other carries to try: troll(miss and bash), drow, NS(carry farm, max hunter, basher), naix<br>
<br>
            Mids/Offlanes<br>
            I think these positions will be much more core, such that offlaners like clock, timber, will fall out and more core style offlaners will be in fashion like Clinkz, weaver, faceless, qop<br>
            Mids will follow the same style, less ganking stuff and more sit in lanes style heroes like OD, nec, sniper<br>
<br>
            Supports<br>
            I think Megatron supports will be in, buffing carries and creating ideal environments for their carries, like Omni, orge (bloodlust), Kotl, Wisp, Lich, Abba, ES(babysitter), Dazzle, Tusk, bane(enfeeble to dick the other carry, and bkb-pentrating ult), sd(distuption)<br>
<br>
            Heroes we I think should practice for next week:<br>
<br>
            X: Dusa, spec, PA(the new way, WK, riki(smoke miss+basher carry, lane presence at lvl 1), naix(built in bkb, basher carry)<br>
            A: Weaver, Huskar(just to try), ET, Beast(aura build, carry punishing), mag, clinkz, kunkaa(ship awesome)<br>
            T: Orge, tusk, lich, naga, abba<br>
            C: Zeus, OD, Gyro, nec, troll, storm<br>
            H: Wisp, omni, kotl, SD<br>
<br>
            Sample greedy lineups:<br>
            Dusa, weaver, abba, od, wisp <br>
            spec, kunkaa, orge, gyro, omni<br>
            PA, ET, naga, storm, sd<br>
            ^^can turn the game at any point<br>
<br>
            Synergies to exploit:<br>
            sd/od, super hard disenegage with prison/disrupt on either xu or their carry<br>
            zeus/spec/furion/wisp, global stuff, dont have to have all 4, just 2 out of the 4<br>
            pa/wisp mid, this is going to be insane with global response and wisp bottle mid<br>
            lich/morph mid, morph is a hard to kill carry, can push waves fast, be in fights with replicate<br>
<br>
            Misc thoughts:<br>
            TB, this hero i think is not very good, despite pro play, lion counters hard with 2 disables, mana drain is 5s kill an illusion and ult rapes his sunder crap<br>
            Omni and spec have the highest winrates right now but if you look at spec, shes worst vs omni, because his ult means you can just turn and fight, and if you have aghs, it literally counters her global crap<br>
