        <p>People will try a bunch of different items of Medusa, but there are really only two items that you need to get, and they are the Eye of Skadi and Divine Rapier. No other items give you better value. Double Skadi, double rapier is not a troll build.</p>

        <p class="oneliner">My thoughts on the 6.82 patch the day after it came out.</p>
        <p>Because carries are highlighted, carry v carry fights or fights that have both carries there are the most important engagements in the game now. Small garbage fights matter less. Carries should be harder to kill, so miss chance/disarm comes in here, and bashers are huge for the carry v carry fights.</p>

        <p>                    Skill build: Max Impetus by level 7, get ultimate whenever you feel physical attacks will be stronger than nukes. (Usually around midgame or level 10/11) Get one level of heal, then get more if your team needs to push early. (It shouldnâ€™t) Stick in the rest with stats.</p>
